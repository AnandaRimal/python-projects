# Python Calculator

## Introduction
This is a simple command-line calculator built in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Supports four basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Allows continuous calculations without restarting
- Includes error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero

## Requirements
- Python 3

## Installation
No external libraries are required. Simply download the script and run it using Python.

## Running the Calculator
1. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python calculator.py
   ```
2. Enter the operation you want to perform (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. Input two numbers.
4. The result is displayed.
5. You can choose to continue with another operation using the previous result or exit.

## Example Usage
```
Welcome to the Calculator!
Enter the operation (*, +, -, /) you want to perform: +
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
The result is: 8.0
Do you want to perform another operation? Type 'yes' to continue or 'no' to exit: yes
Enter the next operation (*, +, -, /): *
Enter the next number: 2
The new result is: 16.0
```

## Error Handling
- If the user enters an invalid operation, they will be prompted again.
- If non-numeric values are entered, an error message is displayed.
- If division by zero is attempted, an error message is displayed instead of crashing.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for exponentiation and modulus operations.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt.
- Allow multi-step expressions instead of one operation at a time.

Enjoy using the calculator! ðŸš€
